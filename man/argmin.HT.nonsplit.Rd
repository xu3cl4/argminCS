\title{Perform argmin hypothesis test.}
\usage{
argmin.HT.nonsplit(data, r, lambda, sample.mean = NULL, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A n by p data matrix; each of its row is a p-dimensional sample.}

\item{r}{The dimension of interest for hypothesis test.}

\item{lambda}{The real-valued tuning parameter for exponential weightings (the calculation of softmin).}

\item{sample.mean}{The sample mean of the n samples in data; defaults to NULL. It can be calculated via colMeans(data).
If your experiment involves hypothesis testing over more than one dimension, compute colMeans(data) and pass it to sample.mean to speed up computation.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level of the hypothesis test; defaults to 0.05.}
}
\value{
A list containing:\tabular{ll}{
   \code{test.stat.scale} \tab The scaled test statistic \cr
   \tab \cr
.   \code{critical.value} \tab The critical value for the hypothesis test. Being greater than it leads to a rejection. \cr
   \tab \cr
   \code{std} \tab The standard deviation estimate. \cr
   \tab \cr
   \code{ans} \tab 'Reject' or 'Accept' \cr
}
}
\description{
Test if a dimension may be argmin without any splitting.
}
\details{
This method is not recommended, given its poor performance when p is small.
