# argminCS
Welcome! Here we have source code to perform argmin hypothesis test.

## Overview
The goal of argminCS is to produce confidence set of argmin from iid samples with a valid type 1 control, while exhibiting desirable statistical power. In particular, the method 'softmin.LOO' is the main innovative component in our paper *Winners with Confidence: Argmin Inference over a High-Dimensional Discrete Candidate Set*. Several other methods are also implemented within the package to ease method comparison and simulations. 

## Citation
If you use the **argminCS** package for your research or any experiment, please cite our paper "Winners with Confidence: Argmin Inference over a
High-Dimensional Discrete Candidate Set". 

## Installation

You can install the development version of argminCS from this [GitHub](https://github.com/) webpage with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("xu3cl4/argminCS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(argminCS)
dimension <- 4
sample.size <- 200
p <- 20
mu <- (1:p)/p
cov <- diag(length(mu))
set.seed(108)
data <- MASS::mvrnorm(sample.size, mu, cov)

## to test if 'dimension' is likely to be argmin with (default) softmin.LOO
difference.matrix <- matrix(rep(data[, dimension], p-1), 
                            ncol = p-1, 
                            byrow = FALSE) - data[, -dimension]
argmin.HT(difference.matrix, method='SML')

## rather than perform a hypothesis testing for a specific dimension, 
## one can directly generate a discrete confidence set by 
CS.argmin(data, method='SML')
```

## Detailed Tutorial
Here is a detailed [tutorial](https://xu3cl4.github.io/argminCS/demo_CSargmin.html). 

Regarding the details of methods and their associated tuning parameters, we encourage users to install the package and check function documentation.
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
