Description: Provides methods to construct frequentist confidence sets with valid marginal 
    coverage for identifying the population-level argmin or argmax based on IID data. 
    For instance, given an n by p loss matrix—where n is the sample size and p is the 
    number of models—the CS.argmin() method produces a discrete confidence set that contains 
    the model with the minimal (best) expected risk with desired probability. The argmin.HT() 
    method helps check if a specific model should be included in such a confidence set.
